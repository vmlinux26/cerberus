# changed the lookup of the ip addresses in the made file and the whois lookup.

# may 4, 2009 
# changed the way that the log files are searched.

# i've noticed a couple of discrepancies in how some isp's have their whois info set up.  i'm 
# working on getting this fixed, so that all ips will get sent to the proper people. this is somewhat fixed with the 
# additional 'whois' statements.  it's an ugly hack but i'm working on it. 
# 
# looking at making a file that keeps the main blocks of ips in it with the abuse info so this becomes faster.

# I wrote this because I was getting tired of all the attempts from the script kiddies out there. Hopefully if 
# enough people can use this program, and do use it, we can get the ISPs to take a look at, and maybe catch 
# some of the little shites that are running the scripts. 
# 
# A couple of things that you're going to need to make this program work properly is to have your dnsdomainname 
# set, a MTA (I'm using postfix) that is working, and hopefully not relaying others mail :­), and your machine clock syncing to an 
# ntp server.  The last one isn't neccesary, but I believe it's important. 
# 
# I made a system user admin, and have it ran as a cron job from the admin user when my files rotate.  This way it's 
# not going to flood the ISPs mail, and yours, with continued sends of the same thing.  Also this script was 
# written for my server(debian), so you might have to modify it to fit yours.  The modification should only be which 
# log file it's searching. If people email me with where the 'Illegal' attempts are located on what distro I will 
# modify the script. 
# 
# You can see what this is doing by running ""bash ­-o -xtrace "mod_ssh.sh" (without the quotes) from the dir that you put it in. 
# 
# If you are going to run this from a cron job as I have, make sure that you specify, "SHELL=/bin/bash" after the 
# name of the file so it runs properly.

### this grabs the first ip in the list. checking to make sure the loop will stop when there are no more ips in the list.

Thank you for taking the time and concern to address this email. 
 
This email was sent to you from a cron job to notify the admin and you, the isp, 
of attempted break ins from an ssh script coming from someone in your block of ip addresses. 
 
My timezone is ${TIMEZONE}. 
My current time is ${CURRENT}. 
Current UTC time is ${UTC}. 
 
Thank you.
