mkdir SSH_Abuse ### we are going to do everything in a dir that we make 
cd SSH_Abuse    ### that way we can keep things nice and clean. 

### look at adding 'ps ax | head | grep init'  --> 'ps p 1'
### if something returns, true, then use the old way checking the log files
### if doesn't return something, false then use what is below
# 
### this will try to use the best of both worlds, sysV and systemctl

journalctl -u sshd.service --no-pager --since `date +%F --date='last Monday'` --until today | grep Invalid > bad_sshd
