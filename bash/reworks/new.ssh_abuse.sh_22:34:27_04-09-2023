# start writing functions
#
# 1st, check system type, systemd or sysinitd
#
# 2nd, keep old, while updating how the commands are called. instead of backticks "`", use the now
# excepted "$(command)".
#
# 3rn, use the journalctl from the old script, mod_ssh.sh.systemd for another function
#
# 4th, will have to write these funtions first, orig and mod_..., and the call them from the test
# system type function
#
# 5th, leave the email part of the original script in place, since that won't, hopefully, have to be updated
#
# 6th, have fun :)
#
# 7th, set up what file/var is written to depending on the unit used in journalctl
#
