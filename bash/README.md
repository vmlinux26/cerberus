Hello, 

I wrote these along time ago because I was getting tired of script kiddies trying to get into my
server.

These were written before fail2ban was around and wanted to try and do something other than just let
things just not be accepted to my server.

Go ahead and look around, the ssh_abuse has the oldest of my scripts and the mod_ssh are newer
versions that use systemd instead of just log files.
