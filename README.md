These are old scripts that I wrote at one time when I started with linux.

Each has an 'old' and a 'reworks' in them.  The old is for how they used to work at one time and the
reworks is for how I'm trying to get them into proper coding format, todays standards.

They are works in progress and I "DO NOT" take any responsibilities for you using them.

when grabbin something always grab the newest one, you can see by the 'date'.  there will be comments
in them to/so that i know what i have done with quick changes.
